# Bus-Reservation-System



Bus Reservation System 
-->Customer can go to the travel agents to book their ticket in advance instead of going to the bus stop on the day of journey with all the uncertainty of getting the seats.
--> And this helps the Bus owner as well, the bus owner can get to know the number of passengers travelling by particular bus so that he can decide on the demand & work on the supply accordingly.
-->Customer can also can cancel his ticket booked well in advance and the Bus owner has their own table where they have penalty set up for the cancellations and Discount on the some bookings
